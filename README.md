# haproxy-samples
HAProxy configuration samples originally shared at 2018 EDUCAUSE Security Professionals Conference.

[What's Your HTTPS Grade? Improve Your Campus Web Security with Open-Source HAProxy Load Balancers](http://slides.com/brandonkish/whats-your-https-grade) was presented by Brandon Kish and Kirk Lehr from [Mid Michigan Community College](https://www.midmich.edu/).

These configuration examples were written for the 1.5 branch of HAProxy, but should be adaptable to newer versions, too.

## Installing HAProxy

We recommend the [Digital Ocean tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-haproxy-to-set-up-http-load-balancing-on-an-ubuntu-vps) for installing and getting starting with HAProxy.

If you <3 Docker, there are [containers available](https://docs.docker.com/samples/library/haproxy/), too!
